# SIP Cluster

The SIP Cluster Operator helps identity appropriate `BareMetalHost` objects to fulfill a tenant cluster, including initial creation as well as expanding and contracting it over time.  It also helps create supporting *per-cluster* supporting infrastructure such as LoadBalancers, Jump Hosts, and so on as value added cluster services for each cluster.
